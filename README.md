# Quiz Mania
Problem Statement: 
Many Colleges, Institutes and academic centers work in manual mode for taking examinations. This is time consuming as well as resource consuming. All such operations are handled on test copies, files or registers manually. This project intends to use the latest advancements in information technology and provide a central web solution for automating some basic examination.This will help many stakeholders of a college, institute or school to quickly do examinations online.


Objective:
It is a good source of interactivities among students and between the teacher and students. It is done in order to improve studentâ€˜s comprehension levels and    learning motivation.  As one of their tools, online test tools are quite effective. However, in order to use the online test tool, a teacher is generally required a great deal of labor.
 For example, a teacher needs to create quizzes and input them in the online test tool.
In order to solve these problems, we have developed a Web-based online test system which can create quizzes competitively and collaboratively by students for the purpose of reducing the load required for a teacher and promoting interactions among students and between the teacher and students.
